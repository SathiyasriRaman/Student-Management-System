#  Student Record Management System (Java + C++)

This is a complete **student record management system** that uses **Java (Swing GUI)** for the frontend and **C++ (Binary Search Tree)** for the backend.  
It allows 10th standard student mark entry (subject-wise), automatically calculates **Total, Average, and Grade**, and provides functionalities to **view, search, delete**, and **display sorted records**.

##  Features

###  Java GUI (Frontend):
- Enter marks for 5 subjects: **Tamil, English, Maths, Science, Social**
- Auto-calculation of **Total**, **Average**, and **Grade**
- View all student records in a scrollable table
- Search student by **Roll Number**
- Delete student by **Roll Number**
- Stores data in a file: `students.txt`

###  C++ Backend (BST Logic):
- Reads data from `students.txt`
- Builds **Binary Search Tree** using Roll Number
- Allows:
  - In-order traversal (sorted display)
  - Search by Roll Number
  - Delete by Roll Number
- Useful for showcasing **DSA and file integration**

##  Technologies Used

- Java (Swing, File I/O)
- C++ (Binary Search Tree, File Handling)
- Text File for shared storage (`students.txt`)
- Windows / Linux Terminal (for C++ execution)
